        - Kicked $self->{caller_level} and replaced it with
          Log::Handler::CALLER_LEVEL. The reason is that if dump(),
          die() or warn() was called then the patterns %p, %f, %c or
          %s was wrong.
        - Changed option filter to filter_message and added a new
          option called filter_caller.

0.44    Released at 2008-06-04.

        - Changed pattern %R to %r.

0.43    Released at 2008-05-21.
        - Fixed log() in DBI.pm and Socket.pm - only try to reconnect

0.41    Released at 2008-05-09.

          not able to log a message. In version 0.40 the handler
          stopped if a message couldn't be logged. That was bad.
        - Did a lot code, POD and internal doc improvements.

0.40    Released at 2008-05-04.
        - A full release - finally :-)

          if buffer is set to 0.
        - Kicked option interval from Log::Handler::Output::Email.
        - All log() methods of each output expects now a hash or a
          hash reference with the message (message => $message).
          Before this change it was possible to pass a hash reference
          or a simple string: { message => $message } or just $message.
        - Some other little improvements: POD, Code, Examples

0.39_16 Released at 2008-04-17.

        - Log::Handler::Levels is now the base class for all level methods.

0.38_12 Released at 2008-02-16.
        - Released with a lot of POD, code and example improvements.

0.38_11 Released at 2008-02-15.

        - Moved the main logic from Log::Handler::Logger back to
          Log::Handler.
        - Renamed Log::Handler::Logger to Log::Handler::Output. This module
          builds the output message and is just for internal usage.
        - Renamed all output modules from Logger to Output.
        - Patterns are not global any more. Now the patterns are stored
          into the Log::Handler object.

        - Fixed example examples/trace.pl.
        - Kicked method levels() from Log::Handler::Logger.

          to deactivate the logging of trace messages to a logfile.

0.38_01 Released at 2008-01-13.
        - Added Log::Handler::Logger and moved the main logger logic to it.
        - Now it's possible to define more than one log file. Each log file
          got it's own Log::Handler::Logger object.
        - The simple call of "Log::Handler->new()" will not create a default
          output object for *STDOUT any more, it just creates an empty Log::Handler object.
        - To add log file the method add() should be used. The first log file can be
          defined by new().
        - The methods close(), set_prefix(), get_prefix are not available any more.
        - The placeholder <--LEVEL--> for the prefix is changed to %L. In addition there
          are different other placeholders available and it's possible to define a postfix.
        - trace() will trace caller informations to all log files that are defined.
        - Did a lot of other code changes.

0.38    Released at 2007-09-29.
        - Kicked set_log_buffer() and get_buffer_log().
        - Did some code improvements and split _print() into different routines.
        - The option filename isn't mandatory any more. The default is *STDOUT.

0.37_01 Released at 2007-07-20.
        - Added set_buffer_log() and get_buffer_log() to Log::Handler.
        - Kicked now the would_log_* methods. Since 0.33 the is_* methods exists

0.37    Released at 2007-07-04.
        - Added option rewrite_to_stderr.

        - Now it's possible to set utf8 on the filehandle.
        - Kicked CLOSE().
        - Kicked File::Stat because CORE::stat() is much faster and I did some
          other improvements. Now _print() is ~50% faster if reopen is used.

0.35    Released at 2007-06-05.
        - Added method trace() to prints caller() to the log file.
        - Did some code improvements and fixed POD typos.

0.34    Released at 2007-05-22.
        - Changed the regex /.*\z/ to /.\z|^\z/ to append a newline if not
          exists because /.*\z/ seems to be a regex bug.

0.33	Released at 2007-05-09.
        - Added 13 is_* methods. They do the same as the would_log_* methods.
        - Added close() as replacement for CLOSE(). CLOSE() exists in further
          releases but is deprecated.
        - Did some code improvements and fix some POD typos.
        - Kicked IO::Handle from PREREQS and autoflush myself on the file handle.

0.32	Released at 2007-04-26.
	    I jumped from 0.15 to 0.32 because there exists brownfields on backpan.
	    Replaced my own routine to get caller() informations with Devel::Backtrace.
	    Added the option debugger_skip.

0.15	Released at 2007-04-25.
        - Fixed typos in POD.
        - Changed the way to activate the debugger. Now the debugger is activated
          over the call of new().

0.14	Released at 2007-04-24.
        - Fixed "use Log::Handler debug => ...".

0.13    Released at 2007-04-20.
        - Added the availability to activate debugging with "Log::Handler debug => 1".

0.12    Released at 2007-04-15.
        - Fixed DESTROY(). DESTROY() tries to unlock $self->{fh} in any case.
        - Autoflush wasn't set if the option "filename" was set to STDOUT or
           STDERR or a GLOBREF.

0.11    Released at 2007-04-10
        - Add the methods set_prefix() and get_prefix(). Did some POD changes.

          maxlevel.

0.11_01 Released at 2007-04-04
        - I changed the log levels because they wasn't in the right order.
          0 debug     is now 7
          1 info      is now 6
          2 notice    is now 5
          3 warning   is now 4
          4 error     is now 3
          5 crit      is now 2
          6 alert     is now 1
          7 emergency is now 0
          8 nothing is still the same
          If you set maxlevel and minlevel as strings in your code than
          you don't need to change your code, but if you used numbers
          than you must change it! BIG sorry to all users that have to
          re-write code in this case.
        - Thanks to betterworld for his tipps about the log levels! (thx pepe ;-))
