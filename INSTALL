To install the module execute the following steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

"make test" do some tests. If you get error messages then
you shouldn't install the module. Otherwise your last step is:

   make install

and have a lot of fun with Log::Handler.

Don't forget to take a look into the "examples" diretory. :-)
